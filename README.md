Overview
This project presents a comparative economic analysis of four major global economies: **India, The United Kingdom, China, and Germany**. 

Utilizing data extracted directly from the **Bloomberg Terminal** (specifically ECST and CORR functions), this report analyzes Gross Value Added (GVA), Manufacturing trends, and the correlation between GDP growth and Inflation for Q3 2024.

## Key Findings

| Country | GDP/GVA Trend | Manufacturing Sentiment | Inflation-GDP Correlation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| India | **Resilient Growth** (↑ Q3 GDP) | Bullish (PLI Schemes) | **-0.004** (Decoupled) |
| UK | **Moderate/Flat** (0.4% Growth) | Stagnant (High Energy Costs) | **0.478** (Moderate Positive) |
| China | **Slowing** (Real Estate Crisis) | Strong but Volatile | **0.812** (Strong Positive) |
| Germany| **Contraction** (-0.2% Decline) | Bearish (Weak External Demand) | **0.392** (Vulnerable) |

## Country wise Analysis

### 1. India: The Resilient Giant 
India demonstrated robust economic resilience in Q3 2024.
* **GDP Performance:** Rose to **₹44.10 Lakh Crore**, driven by strong domestic demand and government expenditure.
* **Manufacturing:** Significant growth from ₹6.84L Cr (Q2) to **₹7.01L Cr (Q3)**, fueled by "Make in India" initiatives.
* **Correlation Analysis:** A near-zero correlation (**-0.004**) between GDP and Inflation suggests that India's growth is relatively insulated from inflationary fluctuations, largely due to proactive RBI monetary policies.

### 2. United Kingdom: Services-Led Stability 
The UK economy showed modest recovery but remains constrained by external pressures.
* **GVA Growth:** A slight increase of **0.4%**, heavily reliant on the Services sector (Financial & Insurance).
* **Manufacturing:** Slowed to **0.8% growth**. The sector is struggling with high energy costs and labor shortages despite government tax reliefs.
* **Correlation Analysis:** A positive correlation (**0.478**) indicates a classic "Demand-Pull" inflation scenario where growth and prices rise together.

### 3. China: Structural Shifts 
China remains a manufacturing powerhouse but faces internal structural challenges.
* **GDP Split:** The economy grew at **4.7%** (down from 5.3% in Q2). While manufacturing remains strong (**6.2%**), the Real Estate sector contracted significantly by **-4.6%**.
* **Correlation Analysis:** A very high correlation (**0.812**) indicates that China's economic expansion is heavily tied to inflationary pressures, likely due to capacity utilization constraints and wage pressures.

### 4. Germany: Industrial Contraction 
Germany is facing recessionary headwinds, heavily impacted by global geopolitical tensions.
* **GVA Decline:** Contraction of **-0.2%** in Q3, following a -0.5% decline in Q2.
* **Manufacturing Crisis:** The industrial heartland shrank by **-1.4%**, hit hard by high energy prices and weak demand from key export partners like China and the US.
* **Outlook:** The country is pivoting toward green energy and automation to regain competitiveness.

## Methodology 
* **Data Extraction:** Bloomberg Terminal.
    * *Function ECST:* For macroeconomic indicators (GDP, GVA, Sectoral breakdown).
    * *Function CORR:* To calculate the statistical relationship between Inflation (CPI) and GDP over the 2020-2025 period.
* **Analysis:** Comparative qualitative and quantitative analysis of quarterly performance.
* **Metric:** Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices and Real GDP YoY%.

##  Conclusion
The analysis highlights a "Multi-Speed" global economy. While **India** rides on domestic consumption and policy support, **China** is managing a difficult transition away from real estate. **Europe** (represented by UK and Germany) faces the brunt of the energy crisis, with Germany specifically showing signs of de-industrialization risks.
